# Project Name

We were asked to design a responsive website (for mobille, tablet and desktop displays). I have tried to do this, making all pages responsive, using Media queries with the appropriate breakpoints.

## The problem

I have used a variety of tools, mainly Adobe Illustrator to design the logos and images. I then used HTML, CSS and the media queries function to make the pages responsive.
