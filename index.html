            </h2>
            <p> Planning, designing and decorating a bedroom for a highly-opinionated 8-year old &#91; known locally as Isabella &#93; is a daunting feat. 
              Gone are the days when I could placate with pictures of cute kittens gamboling with a ball of string. 
              Instead, the room has to reflect the <b>*rather awesome*</b> personality of the inhabitant. 
              Nowadays the colours have to be punchier, there can be a dash of whimsical but never, I repeat never, any hint of babyish-ness. Never.

            <p> The time has come to redesign the extra room we have to meet the needs
              of the family. In short we needed a guest rooom, a place for the Big People
              to work, and a place for the Little People to do their playing-thing....
